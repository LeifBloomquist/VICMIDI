You can pass any values. There are 16 waveforms, and each waveform cycles
thru 16 different shift register states, so each of the 16x16=256 possible
shift register contents is a valid state in one of the possible waveforms.
The "waveform names" I've given are just the shortest possible binary
sequences that set up each waveform.

And yes, you can put these binary numbers directly into A when using the
routine.

It implies that the shift register must be cleared before setting a new
waveform. The easiest way to clear the shift register is switching the
channel off for a short while. It is also important that the shift rate is
fast enough ($7E is the fastest setting).

Of course, it IS possible to change the waveform without fulfilling these
requirements, but in this case the exact change is not predictable. Still,
there is some VIC-20 music (e.g. Orb Megademo, Summer Lameness) that do this
kind of "random unpredictable tweaks" constantly in order to create a unique
kind of sound, so you might want to give the users this possibility as well.

When changing the note: if you just change the frequency (without turning
the channel off), then it is not necessary to set the waveform again.
However, if you have any silence before the new note, then it is necessary
to call the waveform routine again.

It depends on the channel and the pitch it's playing before setting it to
$7E. I once calculated the worst case as being 2160 clock cycles (for the
slowest channel ($900a) on the lowest pitch), but I haven't verified it in
practice as my players never need to change the waveform very often.

Anyway, if you want to be sure you don't wait any longer than you need to,
here's the formula I used:

  offtime in clock cycles = clocks_per_shift * (wavelength + 7)

where clocks_per_shift is 16, 8 or 4 depending on the channel (alto, tenor,
soprano) and wavelength is ((126-PEEK(3687X))AND127)+1.
